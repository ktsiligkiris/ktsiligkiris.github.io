* goals goals goals
It's so difficult to set goals in your life, in your professional
life, in your studies, nearly everywhere. And I'm not sure if this is
only a problem that I face myself or if it is universal. I would
probably think that it's universal. So how do you go about writing
about goals? I guess you sit down and decide on your goals.

That's funny, at least to me, because I've never been able to set a
proper goal, or at least

Fuck it, this doesn't have any structure, maybe unstructured blurb is
my forte.
