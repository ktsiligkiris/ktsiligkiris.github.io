# The idea

It's been a while since I wrote anything here, oh well, life
happens. Anyway, my new pation project is to create, using rust, some
small command line tools that would help me in converting bridge
distributions file formats, creating a lin file to use in a bridge
program created in java, and, who know, possibly replace this java
program with a rust program. But all in due course. My first target is
the converter.


# The bridge converter

My first step in this probably long or short journey, is to crate a
simple command line tool that will convert pbn files (or portable
bridge notation), which I can download from the [Hellenic Bridge
Federation](https://hellasbridge.org), to lin files, that I can upload to aaBridge, a program
written in java that I use for studying the hands that I have
played. The purpose of all this is to study the hands and gradually
become a better bridge player, while I gradually become also a better
rust programmer. I will try to keep notes of all the progress, the
architectural decisions, and the crates on which I will base my
work. My hope is that gradually, I will move from simple command line
tools to a fool fledged program that could substitute the java one.
